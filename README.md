## Kudos
MkFont wouldn't be possible if not for [@fontello](https://github.com/fontello) folks sharing their magic : the app is primarily built around [svg2ttf](https://github.com/fontello/svg2ttf) & [svgpath](https://github.com/fontello/svgpath).  
MkFont uses the [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) database.  
Screenshots are showcasing the font [Meticula](https://freetypography.com/2019/05/16/free-font-meticula/).
