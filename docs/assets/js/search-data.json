There are tons of tools out there that do similar things, even fully fledged glyph editors; but nothing in between. MkFont attempts to fill the gap. I love my current workflow &amp; tools when it comes to vector graphics, and don’t want to have to deal with tools I don’t feel comfortable with. Yet, font export tools out there are often very limited in their feature set when it comes to font metrics, don’t have GUIs, or simply introduce lot of friction if you’re into fast iterations : I can’t be the only one! MkFont hopefully make this super easy : export, batch import, edit in place, tweak metrics, all at a blazing-fast speed. Not a glyph editor . MkFont is not a glyph editor, and never will be. That’s the opposite of the point made above. Since it’s not an editor, it may come out as a really terrible piece of software to academic typographer &amp; typography lovers. And it’s ok! This is not what MkFont has been designed for :) If you’re curious, here’s a small thread full of gifs and screenshots the MkFont development process. Source code . MkFont is licensed under MIT : if you want to look at the code, or if you’re worried it could hurt your machine, the code is available in full on github! You can even compile it yourself. Bugs! . If you encounter a bug, please fill an issue here. Since MkFont run in electron, you can also run the app with the -dev launch parameter, which will provide you access to the console, and thus more details on any error that might be coming up. If you submit a bug, depending on its nature I may ask for the faulty .mkfont file : if you’re working on secret stuff, it would be great if you’re capable of reproducing the bug with assets you’re in a position to share publicly.

Basically you operate transformations based on something that doesn’t have to be the glyph shape. There are only two ways I can know about the relation of your path to the typographic space : . | The SVG viewBox | A custom path that will be used as a reference | . Now you don’t need to bother too much about the technicalities : the viewBox is usually automatically set by your editing software on import. i.e, in the case of Adobe Illustrator, artboards are the viewBox. The one case where there isn’t a viewBox is when you in illustrator, and in MkFont : the vector information is added to the clipboard without any viewBox : instead, it fits tight with your selection within Illustrator. While not a deal breaker, this will limit your ability to really take advantage of MkFont. the bottom edge of the SVG viewBox (if it exists) represents the baseline of the (font) glyph, while the top edge is the height of the character within the font.. This doesn’t have to be true, but most of the scale &amp; fit options rely on some consistent logic in the way you author your SVGs. ",

This would be especially useful in order to re-user marks &amp; modifier along with unmodified glyphs and not duplicate the work/amount of assets required to have a fully functional font | . | Glyph layers | Similar to Glyph as components, working the ability to use existing glyphs as additional \"layers\" inside another Glyph. Glyph would either be used as-is, or with its path reversed in order to create \"holes\" – hence making icon font much more flexible. | . | Add existing glyph to illustrator automation | Currently the Illustrator automation only creates blank templates.

    "content": "Assignation determines how an imported SVG will be assigned to a unicode slot. i.e, what seats it’s supposed to take. Which option to choose from is highly specific to how you like to work, and the type of font you’re working on. File list is internally sorted on import to ensure consistent &amp; predictable behavior. When working with regular font, I highly recommend using From filename and maintain strict naming conventions to avoid wondering whether a glyph should be here or there. However, when working with icon font, it can be preferable to select To block. No matter which assignation mode you choose, you can always set the target slot manually :) Also, the character &amp; slot address (hex value) where the glyph will be imported is visible and updated at all times. At the time of writing, there are four options to choose from: . | From filename | To block | To block (constrained) | To selection | . From filename . As stated in the name, this option will extract the target slot from the filename structure. By default, the importer will try to extract the largest chain of character shared by every single file. If you’re using a default prefix, it should be already set. However, if not, or if incorrect, you’ll have to define it manually. Here are the two things required to extract info from the filename. | Parameter | Expected content | . | Name prefix | A chain of character that indicates the point in the filname where MkFont should start looking for infos.*If all your filenames are completely different, it’s very likely you’ll have to manually set each glyph.* | . | Separator | A custom character that is used to separate the different unicode that compose your glyph.*This is only useful if you work with ligatures.* | . Now, there are two ways to include the slot address in the filename : . | If you’re working with simple letters that are acceptable in a filename, you can use that. | Otherwise, you’ll need to explicitly describe the character address in the form U+0000. | . Examples Name Prefix : char Separator : _ . | Filename | Character/Addresses found | Slot | . | foo-char_A.svg | A | A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A) | . | bar-char_U+0041.svg | U+0041 | A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A) | . | poet-char_A_U+0041.svg | A, U+0041 | AA (custom ligature) | . | char_U+0041_U+0041.svg | U+0041, U+0041 | AA (custom ligature) | . | nay-char_0.svg | 0 | 0 (DIGIT ZERO) | . | nay-char_test.svg | t, e, s, t | test (custom ligature) | . …And so on. Everything before char will be ignored, and everything after is extracted at each ‘_’ . The U+0000 can be added to your clipboard from multiple places in the app. Look for . To block . This option will start importing glyphs into a specific Unicode block of your choosing (from the Reference block list). You can then select where to start importing within that block : . | Selection | Behavior | . | Block start | The import will start at the first index of the selected block. | . | First empty slot | The import will look for the first empty slot within the selected block, and start import from there. | . | Manual offset | *not implemented yet* | . Now, if you import a massive number of glyphs, or simply if you selected first empty slot and there isn’t any, glyphs will still be imported but they will overflow to the next block. If that’s something you want to avoid, have a look at the next option. To block (constrained) . Identical to To block, this mode won’t import glyphs that would fall outside of the selected block’s range. To selection . This is the tricksiest of the gang, probably the less useful too. It requires an active selection within the viewport prior to importation. This selection will be used as target default slot in the order in which the selection has been made. ",

What to input in the field to get what you want is very similar to the way assignation by filename works : content of the field will be parsed to find the slot that matches your input.
