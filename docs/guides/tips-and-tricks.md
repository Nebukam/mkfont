## Using separate .mkfont files as re-usable libraries

There is currently no way to import an MkFont file into another, by design : you can copy/paste-in-place glyphs from an open document to another.  
What I tend to do is keep sets of glyphs in separate .mkfont files that I use as kind-of 'external libraries', pasting what I need from them to another .mkfont file using the {% include shortcut.html keys="Ctrl Shift C" %} / {% include shortcut.html keys="Ctrl Shift V" %} manipulation.  

> This is especially useful if, for example, you have a set of recurring characters that you end up including in different fonts; i.e controller icons and the like.
