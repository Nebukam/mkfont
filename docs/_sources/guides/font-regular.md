# What to expect

This guide is about creating a font using MkFont from scratch.  
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

#### Assumptions :
- You're using Illustrator. *(because we're going to use advanced third party integration)*
- You already have a bunch of glyphs designed, laying around somewhere.
- You really don't want to bother with finding what's the unicode point fits what glyph, boring. *(but you'll need Illustrator, otherwise you need to do the association by hand and it's tedious af)*

You can find all the assets used in this example in the [following package](https://nebukam.github.io/mkfont/assets/guides/simple-font.zip).

## Final output
{: .no_toc}

We're going to make the following font :

{% include img a='guides/sfont/final-output.png' %}

# First steps
The first step will be organizing our messed up glyph into a more structured document, with properly-named artboard : this way we have an export template that we can easily import into MkFont, and make updates a breeze.  
*The idea is to ensure whatever files we export, we can easily import them to a designated unicode slot without any manual correction.*
