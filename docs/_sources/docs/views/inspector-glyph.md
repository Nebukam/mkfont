## Glyph preview

The glyph preview is non-interactive, and shows the all the metrics & guides that currently define the typographic space.

{% include img a='views/glyph-inspector-previews.png' %}

>*The blue boundary box shows the glyph boundaries as currently seen by the transformation algorithm, according to the active transformation settings. If this is not what you were expecting, either play around with the [selected boundary options]({{ '/docs/views/foldout-transforms#boundaries' | relative_url }}), or check your source file.*

# Empty slot inspection

>An empty slot is a that "does not exists". It's neither empty nor has a path, it's simply not part of the font.  
>Unless you started your doc by importing a `.ttf`, this is likely the first thing you'll interact with.
{: .comment }

{% include img a='views/glyph-inspector-null.png' %}

## Header actions

Actions are limited to the following when editing an empty slot :

| Action       | Effect          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|: **Glyph identity** :||
| {% include shortcut keys="U+0000" %} | Copy the unicode address of the glyph to the clipboard. Ligatures will show as '_'-joint Unicode hex values. |
|: **Glyph actions** :||
| {% include btn ico="document-download" %} | Create new glyph by importing an SVG from an external file. *File will become bound for the session according to the app settings* |
| {% include btn ico="clipboard-read" %} | Create new glyph by importing clipboard content. Same as using {% include shortcut keys="Ctrl V" %}. |
| {% include btn ico="reset" %} | Create a new empty glyph. It becomes an customizable void. |
| {% include shortcut keys="Shift" %} + {% include btn ico="reset" %}  | Create a new glyph along with components matching the glyph composition, if any. |

{% include card_any tagged="foldout" %}

### Export

| Property       | Effect          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Export | Whether or not to include the glyph in the exported font. |

### Resource binding

{% include img a='views/glyph-binding.png' %}

If the glyph is currently bound to a file, the binding and the ability to break it ( {% include btn ico="remove" %} ) will show under the preview. Bindings are created during external file imports, either individually using {% include btn ico="document-edit" %}, or during batch import.

>A glyph bound to a resource will re-import itself whenever the file is updated.
>- Empty path will be ignored *(i.e, if the file previously had content but not anymore)* and won't 'reset' the glyph. 
>- Deleted resources will be automatically unbound without affecting the glyph.  
> i.e, it's generally safe to bind resources, and it should never have *destructive* consequences *(unless you mess with your own art)*
{: .infos }

# Multiple glyph inspection

>Note that multi-glyph editing **only affect the glyph that exists**.  
>If you have empty slot within your selection, they will be ignored.
