>You might get a warning using the .exe -- you can still install the app safely, but in case that doesn't cut it for you, I recommend using the unpacked version instead, which doesn't require installation. *You will loose some benefits such as file associations, but that's it*.

>Due to logistical reasons, the latest macOS version may not be the real latest one and lag a few version behind -- although I'll do my best to make major bugfixes & features available swiftly.
